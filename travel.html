    <p>Even though diamonds are Botswana's largest export, its true jewel is the wildlife in it. All the big five game animals are present in the Okavango Delta. It also holds one of the world's largest animal populations, including elephants, lions, cheetahs, and more.

    <p>The Okavango Delta is in the middle of a desert, making it one of the few deltas that stand out from the other ~10000 deltas. Oil deposits were recently discovered in the rock in the Delta. This is a possible threat as extraction companies may pollute the water bodies, risking the lives of over 500 species of animals.
